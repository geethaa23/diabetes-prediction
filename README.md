# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person is diabetic or not using machine learning techniques.  
The model is trained on medical diagnostic data and helps in early detection of diabetes based on health parameters.

This project demonstrates the complete **machine learning pipeline** including:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Prediction

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains medical information of patients with the following features:

| Feature | Description |
|-------|------------|
| Pregnancies | Number of times pregnant |
| Glucose | Plasma glucose concentration |
| BloodPressure | Diastolic blood pressure |
| SkinThickness | Triceps skin fold thickness |
| Insulin | 2-Hour serum insulin |
| BMI | Body mass index |
| DiabetesPedigreeFunction | Diabetes pedigree function |
| Age | Age of the patient |
| Outcome | 0 → Non-diabetic, 1 → Diabetic |
